Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

You are to implement a Machine Learning Evaluation system based on the Multiclass Perceptron
Learning algorithm in Python. You are provided a file with data representing apples. There are 120
apples altogether. Each apple has two features and a class (“A”, “B”, or “C”). Your system must read in
the data file, split such that 70% of apples are used for training and 30% for testing. Use training apples to
learn the model for the problem, then use the 30% apples for testing, and output an evaluation (percentage
of test set which are correctly classified).
